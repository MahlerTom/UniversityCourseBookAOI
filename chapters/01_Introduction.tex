This document shows how you can get ePub-like formatting in \LaTeX{}
with the \verb|memoir| document class. You can't yet export directly to ePub from writeLaTeX, but you can download the source and run it through a format conversion tool, such as \verb|htlatex| to get HTML, and then go from HTML to ePub with a tool like Sigil or Calibre. See \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/16569} for more advice. And they lived happily ever after.
