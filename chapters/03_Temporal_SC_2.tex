\chapter{Temporal Side Channels Part 2} \label{cha:Temporal Side Channels Part 2}

\section*{recap}\label{sec:recap}

In the previous chapter we discussed about RSA cryptosystem~\cite{wikiRSA}, and
presented  the most expensive operation in the RSA. When we need to take the
message (m) and raise it to the power of the key (either the public key, the
private key, the verification key and so on)
\[ C = m^e(modn) \] But the simplest algorithm to raising by a number uses
modular multiplication which is an expensive operation.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics{images/modmul.png}
    \caption{Modular multiplication} \label{fig:modmul}
\end{figure}

Modular multiplication is pretty straightforward. It works just like modular
addition. You just multiply the two numbers and then calculate the standard
name. Examples for Modulo 7 and 15 can be found in \Cref{fig:modmul}. Why
modular multiplication is expensive? Because we have to take the modulo many
times which is as expensive as division. Division is the most expensive integer
operation exists, and  therefore we don't want to do many divisions. So, one way
to do this is by multiplying and multiplying and doing the modular reduction at
the end, but the problem is the runtime of multiplication grows exponentially
with the number of the multiplicands. Other way is with each multiplication do a
\( mod n \), but the numbers grow longer and longer, and the runtime gets higher
and higher, so we can't do that either. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption{Visualization of powers of 10 from one to 1 billion.} \label{vispow10:fig}
\end{figure}

So, as we discussed in the last chapter, the slowest and most trivial way of
implementing modular multiplication is just to take $g$ and multiply it by $g$,
by $g$, by $g$ ($e$ times) \(g^e mod n\) and every once in a while doing modulo
n, either every multiplication or just in the end. The problem with this was
that if e is a number that consists of 1024 bits, then the worst case number
that we might need to multiply $g$ is \( 2^{1024} \) which is a lot, we don't
want to do that.

\section{Efficiently Implementing Modular Exponentiations}\label{sec:Efficiently Implementing Modular Exponentiations}

There are two ways of making this faster, and these two ways are either
performing fewer modular multiplication (instead of  \( 2^{1000} \)  we would
like to do 1000) and we also want the modular multiplication to be less
expensive. The best case, would be same as regular multiplication over integer.
These two ways will reduce the cost of modular multiplication and modular
exponentiations, and this is something we really want to do to make RSA work on
a device.

So, assume we are engineers, we want to implement modular exponentiations very
cheaply. The right thing to do is of course to use some crypto library, but
let's assume that's not possible, we are inventing the new CPU or something. So,
there is very serious book online called the handbook of applied cryptography
(\Cref{fig:appliedCrypt})~\cite{katz1996handbook}. The book is like a phone book
or a recipe book, and is filled with algorithms, proofs and equations you need
for cryptography. Chapter 14 deals with efficient algorithms for multiplicative
proofs. The book contains the ways to do modular exponentiation: very cheaply,
more cheaply and the old fashion approach. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{images/appliedCrypt.jpg}
    \caption{Cover of the handbook of applied cryptography} \label{fig:appliedCrypt}
\end{figure}

The following approach is called the left to right binary exponentiation, also
known as square multiply.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/ltrbe.png}
    \caption{The pseudo-code was taken from the handbook of applied cryptography, page 615.} \label{fig:ltrbe}
\end{figure}

The inputs are $g$ (we want to raise g to the power of $e$, \(g^e\)) and \(e\)
which is a bit string of $t$ ($t$ bits), in the book its $t+1$ (see
\Cref{fig:ltrbe}). The most significant bit is always $1$, because there is no
logic behind raising something to the power of zero. In this algorithm in the
end \(A\) will be the result of $g$ raised to the power of $e$. 

In the beginning we set $A$ to be equal to $1$, and go over the bits from left
to right (from the most significant to the least). Each time we do square ($A$
equal $A$ times $A$, $A=A*A$) and multiply but we don't always multiply, we do
it sometimes. If the current bit is $1$ (the \( i^{th}\) bit) then we multiply
by $g$, $A=A*g$. This is the algorithm. Now, what happens when we do a squaring
operation downstairs? What happens to the exponent upstairs? Its multiplied by
$2$. So \({g^{e}}^2 = g^{2e} \)  and  \(g*g^{e} = g^{e+1} \). Now, we can think
of a binary string, you can write down the bits using shifting (multiplying by
$2$ is shifting) and adding $1$ is just putting one in the place.

So how many modular multiplications will be performed in order raise g to the
power of $e$ (the string is of length $t$)? The answer is \(O(t)\) What is the
base case - lowest amount of multiplication that will be performed? the answer
is $t+1$, the first bit is $1$ (most significant) so we do step 2.2 one time and
all the rest of the string is zeros, and each time we do step 2.1. What is the
highest amount of multiplication that will be performed? Answer: $2t$, if all
the bits $1$ I do each time $2$ multiplications (step 2.1 and step 2.2). Anyway,
this is \(O(t)\).

So, instead of \(2^t\) as in the old algorithm we performed at most $2t$
multiplications. 

Lets review an example. Lets calculate \(7^6=7^{(110)}\) in the group \(
\mathbb{Z}_{15}={1, 2, 4 ,7, 8, 11, 13, 14} \).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  \(A = 1 = 7^(0) \)
	\item  \(A = A*A = 1 = 7^{(0<<1)} = 7^{(0)}\)
	\item  \(A = A*7 = 7 = 7^{(0+1)} = 7^{(1)}\)
	\item  \(A = A*A = 4 = 7^{(1<<1)} = 7^{(10)} \)
	\item  \(A = A*7 = 13 = 7^{(10+1)} = 7^{(11)} \)
	\item  \( A = A*A = 4 = 7^{(11<<1)} = 7^{(110)} \)
\end{enumerate}

Are there any ways doing it even faster? the answer is yes we can open the
handbook of applied cryptography and find some others. The general thought of
these algorithms is that we do some precomputation. In RSA there is a public
number that you know that you are going to start, so g is known number, we don't
care what $g$ is. So if we know what g is we can prepare all sort of lookup
tables, in the window method we take each time three bits at the same time, and
instead of doing \(A*g\) we do\( A*g*g\) or \(A*g*g*g\) .. (8 values we can
use), and instead of \( A=A*A\) we do \(A=A*A*A\) and so on, this is the sliding
window. There is binary method, you can just look at the book and find out (page
616 algorithm 14.83, in the handbook of applied cryptography). So this is how
you reduce modular multiplications and we can assume that any reasonable crypto
implementation is not doing the naive method. It will use the left to right or
the right to left which is basically the same idea or one of the window methods.

But what if we want the modular multiplication to be cheaper? There is a way and
it's called the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)~\cite{dingyi1996chinese}, which
is called after Sun Tzu Suan, that was a teacher from the \nth{5} century and he
wrote a book that contained all sorts of riddles and questions. And there is the
riddle: 

``there are certain things whose number is unknown.  If we count them by threes
we have two left over; by fives we have three left over; and by sevens, two are
left over. How many things are there?" 

The answer is 23 and how it was discovered? Brute-force. So the CRT states that
you have to have an equation set over modulo other multiplicative group such as
this, you can solve it modulo $p$, you can solve it modulo $q$, this is more
general theorem. You can solve it modulo the underling primes then combine them,
and if there is only one solution in each of the sub-groups there is only one
solution in the big group. What this means is that if we want to do modular
multiplication in this big field modulo $N$, we can actually do the computation
in modulo $p$ and modulo $q$ and then we can combine them together. Why does
this help us (we have to do 2 operation instead of one)? Answer: to do
exponentiation in CRT we take our  big number and do modulo $p$ and again modulo
$q$ and then there is a CRT step. So these two modular exponentiations, what is
the size of the operand they are using? Assuming that $p$ and $q$ are of the
same size? Let's say $p$ and $q$ is 1000 bits so the size of $n$ is 2000 bits
(we add the number of bits of each number in the multiplication).  So each
number in the multiplicative group is about 2000 bit because its mod $N$, so
multiplying two numbers is going to be multiplying two numbers which are 2000
bits. If we reduce it to modulo $p$ and modulo $q$ my numbers are going to be
half the size (1000 bits). So if we take a multiplication and now we will
multiply two number that are half the bit length what is the speed improvement I
get? It's times 4. Instead of one modular exponentiation we have one baby
modular exponentiation which costs me quarter of the time and another one which
cost me quarter of the time and a step (the CRT step which is a modular
multiplication of the two). How much we spent in total? Answer: a bit more than
half the time, twice speedup. Why can't we do that further? Divide $p$ and do it
again? Answer: because it's a prime number ($p$ and $q$) that's the whole point.
So if you do the CRT each modular exponentiation will take less time. 

Now there is a really nice trick, to make modular multiplications very cheap and
this actually makes modular multiplications as cheap as regular multiplication.
So, magic, what is the problem? Multiply two number is pretty easy but the
problem is reducing after multiplying. So what if there is a way of doing
modular multiplications without the reduction step? So in 1985 a genius
mathematician called peter Montgomery published a paper called ``modular
multiplication without a reduction step"
~\cite{warren2013hacker}\footnote{https://www.hackersdelight.org/MontgomeryMultiplication.pdf}.
So the idea is there is a kind of magical world called the Montgomery
representation and you take your number and you step into the Montgomery world
where modular multiplications do not require reducing step and when you finish
you step out of this world and you are back with your result. It's still cost
you like a multiplication but it doesn't cost you the extra reduction step. So,
what is the idea of the Montgomery reduction? we want to calculate \(g^emodn\)
and to do that we need to pay a lot of modular reduction which we  don't want.
So, the first thing we do is enter the Montgomery representation and we do the
Mont(\(g^e\)) and each one of this multiplication steps is going to be about as
difficult as regular multiplication (Figure Figure \ref{montg:fig}). When we
finished with this we exit the Montgomery representation and then we have our
result. Entering and leaving the Montgomery representation costs as much as
modular multiplication but in the middle it's as cheap as regular
representation.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/montg.PNG}
    \caption{General sketch of Montgomery Exponentiation} \label{montg:fig}
\end{figure}

Now lets review how the Montgomery Exponentiation works inside
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Choose a value R, \(R>n\), which is easy to use (usually a large
	power of 2)
	\item  \(Mont(a)=a*R(mod n) =^{def}  a(mod n)\)
	\item  \(Mont(ab)=a*b*R(mod n)=\underline{a}*\underline{b}*R^{-1} (mod n)\)
	\item  \(... \)
	\item  \( = (\underline{a}*\underline{b} +
	(\underline{a}*\underline{b}*n'(mod R)*n))/R(modn) \) \newline
	// if this is more than n, subtract n
	\item  \( A = A*A = 4 = 7^{(11<<1)} = 7^{(110)} \)
	\item  Result: Instead of modular reduction, we only (sometimes) subtract
\end{enumerate}

The first thing to do is to choose a very large value $R$. which is larger than
$n$ and should be easy to use ($a$ large power of 2) for instance 1 and 1000
bits of zero. What does it mean easy to use? To multiply and divide by a power
of 2 you just shift left and right. To calculate the modulo of very large number
that is a power of 2 you do bitwise and with this large power of 2. if
$R=100000$ and $x = 10101010101110$ so to do  modular reduction we just take the
lower bits which are 01110 in this case. So we see its very cheap operation with
$R$, but $R$ is not useful outside the situation. So to enter the Montgomery
representation we are going to multiply by $R$, this multiplication is modulo
$n$, this is a bit expensive. So let me ask you, how do I know that $R$ is
inside the multiplicative group? How do I know that multiplying by $R$ doesn't
throw me outside of mod n? The answer is: how do we know that 2 is inside the
group? Because what is this group? This group is a multiple of two prime
numbers, and they are odd. Thus 2 doesn't divide either one of them so 2 is in
the group and \(2*2*2...2\) is in the group. We call the new number
\underline{a}. The idea is that the numbers in the Montgomery representation is
cheap so how is it cheap with \underline{a} If we multiply a and b in the
Montgomery's representation It will be: \(a*b*R mod n\). but if I want to do
that using \textbf{a} and \underline{b} we  get:
\(\underline{a}*\underline{b}R^{-1}\)mod $n$ because of the extra R. So every
time we multiply two numbers we need to take out the extra R. Inverting $R$ is
just using GCD and can be done before we start the computation. There are much
more derivations made to get to  \((\underline{a}*\underline{b} +
(\underline{a}*\underline{b}*n'(mod R)*n))/R(modn) \).
\underline{a}*\underline{b} is just a single multiplication.
\underline{a}*\underline{b}*n'(mod R) - Notice that \(modR\) is a cheap
operation because $R$ is 1 with lot of zeroes. (n prime (n') is just precomputed
number doesn't really matter to us). Then we multiply it by $n$ (another
multiplication) and then we divide it by $R$ which is also simple operation. So,
we have 4 multiplications and we need a modular reduction which is the core
problem. Montgomery proofed that this sum is no more than \(2^n\). So how do you
do a reduction if the number is between 0 to \(2^n\)? you put an if statement.
If $x$ is less than $n$ you do nothing, if $x$ is larger than $n$ you subtract
from the number n. So now, instead of division we do a couple of multiplications
over integers which is not such a big deal and then we sometimes subtract. This
is a lot cheaper than the regular option and is widely used. Notice the if
statement in the algorithm, it is changing the execution time and might enable a
timing attack.

\section{Temporal Side Channel on RSA}\label{sec:Temporal Side Channel on RSA}

Lets review a do temporal side channel attack on RSA. Kocher described this
attack on his paper in 1995 among other things. If the RSA runs slower than
there are more subtractions and by timing the execution we can recover the key.
So how to do this? How to recover the key by timing the execution? There was a
fantastic paper ``A Practical Implementation of the Timing
Attack"~\cite{dhem1998practical} which the remainder of this section is based
on. So what is the game here? Assume we are an attacker who wants to commit a
timing attack at the secure implementation of RSA. We have a device (a smart
card) and sending him a request, for instance ``please allow to pay 1000 dollars
to Alon" (see \Cref{fig:smart card}). The smart card check that I have 1000
dollars in the bank account and then it replies ``I approve this transaction and
sign it" so this card has stored value inside which means he has money inside.
we would like that if we request ``pay Alon 1 million dollars" the smart card
will say ``I don't have enough funds I am going to refuse". As an attackers we
would like to be able to sign any message we want, mainly messages like ``please
send Yosi 1 billion dollars". The smart card will not allow it but if we got the
private key (signing key) we could sign whatever message we want. So we send the
smart card a message that is unsigned and he in return sends back a signature
which is the response signed with the private key: \(m^s mod n\) where s is the
secret key. So as an attackers we can send as many queries we want and we
allowed to recover the responses (the signatures). The goal is extract the
secret key. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/smartcard.png}
    \caption{The timing attack principle} \label{fig:smart card}
\end{figure}

So, let's look a bit closer in the attack model, what messages we can send to
the smart card? Can we send any message we want? The answer - we can only send
valid messages, if the message is not valid the smart card will just throw them
away. So, this is somewhere in the scale between the weakest model and the most
powerful model. In this scenario the most permissive attack model is known plain
text. Known plain text means that we can see the messages as they go in the
smart card but cannot change them. So the next thing is chosen plain text, we
can't  just chose any plain text, it has to follow a certain rule. The next
thing is completely chosen plain text which doesn't enforce any rules, and the
last thing is adaptive plain text which means we can look at the response and we
can think the next that we will send. So, what is the attack model, we send
requests, the smart card is signing them, and we get the responses and also we
know that the smart card is using Montgomery RSA because it is a reasonable
assumption. So how to use it to extract the key? So we are going to use a method
named ``Vaizata" method which can be found in the DPA handbook. This is a
general way of performing a side channel attack using statistics. \newline

\underline{The ``Vaizata" Method}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Make a simple assumption about the implementation
	\item Guess a little part of the key
	\item Make hypothesis about the effect of the guess on the execution
	\item Classify the measurements according to the hypothesis
	\item If we guessed right, the classification will be statistically
	meaningful
\end{itemize}

How does it works? First, we make a simple assumption on the implementation, an
assumption could be: We assume that the implementation run on software (the
other possibility is the hardware) what does it gives us? Software is executed
serially and in the hardware it's not the case. We can assume for example that
the key is stored in a flash memory on the device, and every time we need to use
the key you need to read the flash memory. How can we find that this is the
case? How can we find first of all that a device is on the hardware or on the
software? One way is to look at it, We can open the screws and look with a
microscope, We can go to this wonderful website called ``I fixed it". They
disassemble all sorts of devices and share this information. What is the sign
that the device is using software? If there is an update on the firmware,
because when it wakes up it needs to find out what software to run. We can say
this device uses memory, We can also say things about when the device is doing
the encryption. So let's assume the device under test is a remote controller.
Inside the controller there is a secret key stored and also a counter. Whenever
the button is pressed the remote controller constructs a package containing the
serial number of the controller, the counter and whatever Boolean state of the
button (which ever button was pressed). Then it sends it to a car and the car
decrypts it. Why by the way do we need a serial number? Each ECU in the car has
program to accept remote controls. So why do we need the counter? Without the
counter an attacker can repeat a message sent from the remote controller to the
car only by reading the messages and sending them again. What happens when you
press the button and the car is in the train station? The counter in the remote
controller is out of sync with the counter in the car, there is a window of
counter values the car will accept, if its closed the car will open without
complaining. If it's a little closed we will need to press the remote control
twice and when the car will see consecutive values it will open, but if it is
too far it won't open. let's assume We can find out when the controller is
transmitting (it is a very intensive operation that takes battery life and also
radiates). So we know the moment in time when it is transmitting, did the
encryption happened before or after the transmitting? Answer: before. Let's
assume that the counter stored in the memory, let's say we found the moment in
time when the chip is reading from memory, did it happen before or after the
encryption? Answer: after, because we need the counter to be included in the
message that will be sent.We can also make more assumptions such as ``the AES
uses an 8 bit data pack or 16 bit or 32 bit", some of these assumptions might be
wrong but the ``vizata" method will help us to find out if they are wrong. 

So first of all We make a simple assumption, assume that the smart card is using
left to right binary exponentiation using Montgomery and this is a very
reasonable assumption because everybody is using this method. The next thing to
do is recursively (or inductively) guess a little part of the key. if we guessed
the whole password it would take us exponential time but if we could guess a
small part of the key each time it would take a linear time. So, we will try
guess small parts of the key first, maybe the simplest thing to explain is
guessing one bit or a single character but lets say we are guessing a small part
of the key. So now we know the beginning of the key and there is a little part
we don't know. So the next step, we need to make a guess about what kind of an
effect our guess is going to have on the computation. We can say, for example,
if we will guess the bit correctly than something will happen to the
computation, if we will guess this key bit correctly it will take more
power/take longer time/connect to the network more often, some kind of phenomena
we can measure. So, in our case what is the only thing we can measure? Answer:
time. we assume that if there is a Montgomery reduction in the calculation of
this bit than the entire computation is going to take a little more time.


SO what is going on here? There is a very large computation here, we were able
to guess the beginning of it but not the end of it. Now we are going to classify
the measurements according to our hypothesis, in this case two groups (with or
without Montgomery computation). If we guessed correctly then it will take
longer to the group we said it will take longer. If not, it might take less or
more, we don't know. If we guessed correctly, the groups will have meaning,
means will will be able to statistically tell apart the set of the measurements
that will take a longer time and the set of measurements that will take less
time. We are going to guess the left most bit of the key, there are only two
options, most of the cases it will be 1. The next bit? 1 or 0. Now, we can
simulate the running of this algorithm with our guess, not all the key but only
the part we know and if there is going to be Montgomery reduction. So assume we
have g, e and N. The device under test is calculating \(g^emodn\) where g came
from? Supplied by the attacker. What about of e? secret we want to discover
(\(e_t,e_{t-1},..,e_0\)) What about of N? public variable (known). The first
thing it does, it enters the Montgomery representation. This information of how
to enter the Montgomery representation is known to the attacker. It starts with
g, then g becomes Mont(g), the attacker can also do it. First \(A=1\), than
\(A=A*A\) the next thing is \(A=A*g\) because we know that the most significant
bit is 1. The next step is \(A=A*A\), now what is next? It depends, if
\(e_{t-1}\) = 0 then \(A=A*A\) (skipping to next bit). Else if \(e_{t-1}\) = 1
then \(A=A*g\). What happens next now we don't know. We can run both
calculations, in particular we can find out if there was a reduction step in two
optional operations. There are 4 option either one containing reduction step,
neither or both. We can know exactly, assuming we make a guess on \(e_{t-1}\),
if there is going to be an extra reduction step. We know enough to guess, if we
guess correctly, we can know if there will be reduction step because we can
calculate all the alternative options completely. So, lets do this now, we have
many different g's, we have repeated this step many times, and for each of these
g's we know if there is going to be an extra reduction step. So, now let's see
how we do an attack using this. So, there is private key s, public key v and
signing operation \(m^s mod n\). 

We begin the attack with a bag of messages, all of them are valid, and we send
them to the device under test (DUT). The DUT signs these messages (k messages),
and for each one of the messages we get a trace, which is the data we collected
using the side channel attack in this case it is only the time. now we have a
vector of size k and each element in the vector is the time it took to sign the
message. Now, we are going to try to guess \(s_t,s_{t-1}\) \((s =
s_t,s_{t-1},s_{t-2},…,s_0)\) and try to discover \(s_{t-2}\). 

So for each of the messages and each key guess we are going to simulate the
computation as far as we already know and in addition for the parts of the key
we don't know we are going to simulate twice, why? One with a 0 and one with a
1. We are going to find out where the extra reduction step happens. If the next
bit is 0, some of the messages have extra reduction we classify the message into
two bins, those who got extra reduction and those who didn't. But maybe the key
is not 0 maybe its 1. So we can simulate the same thing with the next bit as 1,
and find out different set of messages with an extra reduction step. We can't
find what the bits are but we can make a guess and simulate on both 0 and 1. So,
now we divide our traces into two groups in 2 different ways, if the next key
bit is 0 \(m_1,m_2,m_4,m_5,m_7\) got extra reduction and \(m_3,m_6,m_8,m_9\)
didn't. If the next key bit is 1: \(m_2,m_3,m_5,m_8\) got extra reduction and
\(m_1,m_4,m_6,m_7,m_9\) didn't (see \Cref{fig:extraRed}). 


\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/extraRed.PNG}
    \caption{Key bit guess simulation} \label{fig:extraRed}
\end{figure}

If we guessed correctly what can we tell about the messages that got extra
reduction? Answer: the runtime will be a little longer if we guessed the key bit
correctly and If we guessed incorrectly it means we divided into two random
groups which means the runtime will be similar in both groups. So if we guessed
correctly the difference of runtime between the groups will be measurably
different. So now we are going to change the discussion about the messages into
the traces.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/extraStat.PNG}
    \caption{Guessing correctly the key bit makes the statics measurably different} \label{fig:extraStat}
\end{figure}


if the next key bit is 0 then the statistics of the runtimes of 0 bit with extra
reduction are going to be different from the runtimes of 0 bit without extra
reduction. If we guessed wrong the runtimes of 1 bit with extra reduction will
be different from 1 bit without extra reduction. Notice that we are not saying
average or mean anywhere, because they are not required, it could be the
variance changes or something else, the point is that there is some kind of
difference that we can measure. So, how can we find out which of these two
divisions is the correct one? Answer: we have two divisions of k traces, we
measure distance of means. We are going to calculate the mean runtime of each
part (0 bit with or without the extra reduction and 1 bit with or without the
extra reduction) and subtract between with/without extra reduction in each bit
guess. If there is a large distance of means of the 0 bit guess as oppose to the
1 bit guess than probably the splitting of traces in the 0 bit guess is more
meaningful than 1 bit guess, if we are able to split meaningfully then we
guessed the key correctly. Now, let's go back into statistics and talk about the
T-test~\cite{wikittest}. The T-test was invented by William Sealy
Gosset~\cite{wikigosset} who was a chemist who worked for a very famous brewery
in Ireland (Guinness). So, what is the idea? We have two populations that are
different in some way. There are two kinds of t-tests, pair T-test and unpaired
T-test. what is the paired T-test? lets assume we claim that we are going to a
tree and we taking the leaves that fall off the tree. We notice that the leaves
that fall on the south side have less mold that on the north side, why is that?
Because there is more sun on the south side that is drying the leaves. 

How do we prove our theory? We send our undergrad research assistant to collect
a bag of leaves form the north side and a bag of leaves from the south and now I
tell the undergrad to count the percentage of mold in the southern and northern
leaves. When the undergrad comes back, very exhausted, he provides us with an
excel file that have 1000 leaves from the north side and 1500 from the south
side. Now we want to prove our theory, each one of the leaves has a mold, We
want to prove that there is a statistical difference between the two groups,
this is the unpaired T-test. What is the paired? It is when we are talking about
something which we can identify as pairs. For example, we are developing a
cancer medicine and we want to test it. Now, we don't take any undergrads but
only very sick mice with cancer. We measure the weight of the tumor in order to
have a list of 100 mice and tumors. Then we divide them into two groups, one we
treat with my medicine and the other we don't. In the end of the experiment, we
measure the tumors again, but now each measurement is a pair, one before
treatment and one is after. And we want to say that the size of the tumor is
smaller after the treatment. Now let's review the student's unpaired T-test demo
in Matlab. The mat in Matlab is for matrix, we can define matrix like this:

    \caption{Defining a matrix of size 1x10 with increasing numbers from 1 [1,2,3,…,10]} \label{fig:defmat}

    \caption{\(x>5\) will result with logical array [0, 0, 0, 0…, 1, 1, 1, 1]} \label{fig:defmat3}
\end{figure}

The function randn(1) which creates normally distributed random variable which
follows a Gaussian distribution which means the variance is 1 and the mean of 0.
What is the minimum value this function will output? Answer: None, but
statistically the value is closer to 0. How can we create a random variable with
mean different from 0? Answer: add the mean, if we want mean N. we will do $N$ +
randn (1). We can even create a vector of randomly chosen numbers using randn
(1, 5) + 5 : [4.9369, 5.7147, 4.7950, 4.8759, 6.4897] and if we will do randn
(1, 5)*.1 + 5 the numbers will be even closer to 5. So, now we are ready to try
the student T-test.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \fbox{
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/defmat4.png}}
    \caption{In the code, 2 vectors are created - x and y in the same size (which is not obligatory), $x$ will be randomly distributed with a mean of \(mu_{1}\) and variance of \(sigma2_1\) and vector $x$ is going to be random distributed with a mean of \(mu_2\) and variance of \(sigma2_2\). Then there is a code for plotting both vectors (in different colors).} \label{fig:defmat4}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption{Plotting of the vectors for \(mu_1 = 10, mu_2 = 20\)} \label{fig:defmatplot}
\end{figure}

Looking only on the graphs can we say they are from the same distribution?
Answer: we can't be sure. We want to run the T-test to find out if they are
statistically significant. There is a hypothesis and we need to either reject or
accept the hypothesis. If \(H_0\) than they are from the same distribution and
if \(H_1\) than they are from different distributions. If we run the code the
result will be that they are of different distributions with 0.959 certainty.
Each time we ran we can get different results, if the certainty is smaller than
0.95 in matlab, the hypothesis is rejected. How can we make it more difficult
for the ttest2? Answer: if we change \(mu_2\) to 11, than they will be very
close distributions.

    \caption{Plotting of the vectors for \(mu_1 = 10, mu_2 = 11\)} \label{fig:defmatplot2}
\end{figure}

How we as attackers will handle this situation? Answer: run many times. So we
change the vector length (such as 50000). There is something called power
analysis, which means given these parameters (mu and sigma) how many
measurements you need to run to be sure with 95%. As engineers we don't really
care about T-tests, we have a budget of measurements and we just take the one
with the larger mean distance, but what if we are wrong (guessed 1 instead of
0)? Answer: after we guessed one bit wrong all the bits afterwards are wrong
because they are simulated wrongly. So, how can we simulate a full attack? If we
guessed 1 bit using the differences of means then we continue to the next bit in
linear time. Lets review  a figure from " A Practical Implementation of the
Timing Attack" which you are encouraged to read.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/figpita.png}
    \caption{x axis – is the bit index from right to left (the left most bit is known to be 1) and y axis – is the distance of means we chose (some times its 500 or 100 but after 151 the distance of means is a lot smaller which means we guessed a bit wrong). How to solve it? Answer: go backwards and backtrack.} \label{fig:figpita}
\end{figure}

Now lets talk about counter measurements. When Kocher announced the attack to
the cipherpunks mailing list there was kind of discussion about it. Here is a
message (see \Cref{fig:paul}) from there that was sent by Ron Riverst. He was
replying to William Simpson, who was the author of Photuris which is related to
the IPsec protocol and was used for kits change in the IP protocol. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/paul.png}
    \caption{The message.} \label{fig:paul}
\end{figure}

When he read that this attack can attack Photuris, Bill replied: don't worry
this will be fixed in Photuris. How to do this? By dithering the return time of
identification message a few extra milliseconds. Which means he is doing
mitigation, he is not adding a random delay because random is very expensive, he
is going to finish the calculations and is going to look at the clock and
exactly when the millisecond changes (or second) send the package. What does it
mean? It means that since the beginning is random then he is going to add random
delay. So, what Ron Rivest replied? It will reduce the data leakage but will not
eliminate it. Why so? How the attacker will overcome this? Answer: he will need
to measure more, this is network-based protocol, the attacker can measure many
more times. He says, in addition, the public key computation time should be
constant and independent from the message being sent. Ron Rivest suggest
prevention as a countermeasure. So, what time it is going to be? Answer: the
worst-case time. he adds a side note that this kind of attack is very difficult
to mount in an internet environment due to packet-routing timing variabilities,
however it is wise to be careful. Few years later a demonstration was presented
over the internet, there were more measurements to counter the routing problem.
Adding noise is sometimes the only thing that works, sometimes it works
sometimes it doesn't, if you add enough noise to delay the attack time up to a
year the message might not be relevant by the time the attack succeeds.

So, lets talk about two counter measurements, which are preventions. The first
one is called RSA blinding. RSA blinding is a prevention counter measure which
actually works on average time and not worst-case time. we have secret key S and
want to calculate \(m^s mod n\), and the attacker gives us m and we don't want
to leak s. We showed that with enough m from the attacker he will successfully
retrieve s. 

So, how do we do blinding? First of all, we can do this even before the attacker
arrives, we generate random $r$ and calculate \(r^v mod n\) and \(r^{-1} mod
n\). these calculations are not reviling any secrets because v is the public
key. The attacker gives us m, so we calculate: 

\[X = (r^v * m) mod n\]
\[Y = X^s = (r^v*m)^s = r^{vs}*m^s = r*m^s mod n \] 
\[ // v*s mod n = 1 mod n)\]

Now, $Y$ is leaking information because we raise a number to the power of the
secret key, but $r$ is random number which the attacker doesn't know so he can't
simulate the execution. How we remove r? We just calculate 

\[S = Y*r^{-1} = r*m^s*r^{-1} = m^s mod n\]

Why doesn't everybody use it? Answer: because its expensive, 2 modular
exponentiations instead of 1. Another problem is the random number generation,
its hard to find random number generator. You can see RSA blinding in openPGP. 

Now lets review another countermeasure. It called square and always multiply
(see \Cref{fig:saama}). It is very similar to the square and multiply, just
instead of only when \(d_i\) is 1 we will always calculate the multiply but the
assignment will be only when \(d_i\) is 1. The problem with this is not the
extra computation that came from turning sometimes to always. Speculative
execution is always looking for instruction to execute, how does it decide if it
will execute an instruction? If all its dependencies are met. If I say \(a =
b*c\) and \(e = b*c\) they can run both in the same time. what happens is when
the instruction brought to the CPU there is actually nobody is waiting for t, so
as soon as it finishes to run the \(s =s *s mod n\) and \(d_i\) is equal to 0 it
will just return s. Moreover, the compilers are also capable of detecting such
cases and optimize them by dismissing the else statement. So if we have a very
simple CPU with no speculative execution no compiler and we wrote it in assembly
we wont be able to attack it, but we could use power analysis.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{images/saama.png}
    \caption{Square and always multiple algorithm} \label{fig:saama}
\end{figure}

If we run this algorithm as is, we have two places in memory for s and for t,
every action we load s then multiply and then edit the memory of s, same goes in
the multiply section. We load s and m then multiply and then store it in s. It's
always loading and storing s, but what happens when it goes to the else segment:
it loads s loads m and then store into something other then s. So the power
consumption is different between the store and the load. You can read more in
the paper (``defeating RSA multiply-always and message binding" by Marc F.
Witteman et al.~\cite{witteman2011defeating})

Side channel attacks can get not only computer secrets but human secrets too.
What exactly is a human secret? Browsing history for example. How does the
website figure out our browsing history? Theoretically, we can delete the
history in the browser. But what happens when we click on a hyper link (blue
link)? It turns purple after the click. So, there was a nice trick that websites
used to do, they attached the link to an HTML element and added JavaScript code
that at the change of the color can now update that you have visited the site.
The world wide web consortium decide that it was a privacy leak and you are not
allowed to read the color of an HTML element anymore. Now we can set the color
but can't read it. One of the speakers in the black hat 2013 used timing attacks
to find out if a web site was visited or
not\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOQfYlyIqw}}. He also
demonstrated how he can also use timing attack to read the user's stream.
